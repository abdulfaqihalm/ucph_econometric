## Econometric Summer Course at The University of Copenhagen 2023

This repository contains materials as well as the assignments of Econometric Summer course at UCPH in 2023. This course is all about OLS (Ordinary Least Square) model with all of the things that related to it: assumptions, inference, asymptotic and non-asymptotic properties, heteroskedasticity, data issue, IVE, etc. Beside heavily relied on math, this course also offered practicality in the form of assignments. All of the assignment files are in Quarto format (.qmd). I also provided the rendered file in html format.
